# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-25 (re-audit after Phase 7 completion)
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 29/32 requirements satisfied

## Executive Summary

Phases 1-5 and 7 are complete. 29 of 32 v1 requirements are satisfied. Phase 6 (Session Entry and Polish) is not started — its 3 requirements (JOIN-04, SESS-01, SESS-02) are the only gaps blocking milestone completion. Phase 7 closed the SYNC-02 gap from the previous audit. All cross-phase wiring is verified. 191 tests passing across 14 files.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Requirements | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | Sync Layer Hardening | Complete | SYNC-01..05 (5/5) | No VERIFICATION.md (pre-workflow) |
| 2 | App Shell | Complete | SHELL-01..03, JOIN-01..03 (6/6) | Passed |
| 3 | Song Rendering | Complete | SONG-01..05 (5/5) | Passed |
| 4 | Navigation and Leader Controls | Complete | LEAD-01..04, LIST-01..03 (7/7) | Passed |
| 5 | Follower UX | Complete | FOLL-01..04, PRES-01..02 (6/6) | Passed |
| 6 | Session Entry and Polish | Not started | JOIN-04, SESS-01, SESS-02 (0/3) | N/A — blocker |
| 7 | Leader Disconnect UI | Complete | SYNC-02 (1/1) | Passed |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Source Key
- **V** = VERIFICATION.md status

| PRES-02 | Phase 5: passed | 05-02, 05-03 | [x] Complete | satisfied |

*Phase 1 requirements marked "satisfied*" — functionally complete (code exists, tests pass, requirements checked off) but lack formal VERIFICATION.md. Phase was completed before the verification workflow existed.

### Unsatisfied (3/32) — Phase 6 Blockers

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| JOIN-04 | User can scan QR code to join | Phase 6 | No QR scanner component exists |
| SESS-01 | Leader displays QR code for others to scan | Phase 6 | No QR display component exists |
| SESS-02 | Session codes use Dead song names | Phase 6 | Server generates codes (`generateSessionCode()` in protocol.ts, called in server `onStart`) but no client UI exposes them to users |

## Integration Check

**Cross-phase wiring:** 18 exports properly used across phases. 0 orphaned exports within completed phases.

**E2E Flows:**

| Flow | Requirements | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| User joins via session code | SHELL-01, JOIN-01-03, SYNC-01 | Complete |
| Leader navigates songs | LEAD-01-03, SYNC-01 | Complete |
| Follower browses and snaps back | FOLL-01-04 | Complete |
| Leader disconnects, grace period shown | SYNC-02 | Complete |
| QR code join | JOIN-04, SESS-01, SESS-02 | Blocked (Phase 6) |

**Notable:** `generateSessionCode()` exists on the server side and produces Dead song codes (e.g., `scarlet-042`). The server's HTTP `onRequest` endpoint returns `sessionCode` in JSON. But no client component fetches or displays it — users must manually enter room codes.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Sync Layer Hardening
- No VERIFICATION.md — phase executed before verifier workflow existed
- SUMMARY files lack `requirements-completed` frontmatter
- Hibernation + storage sharding not tested against actual Cloudflare deploy

### Phase 5: Follower UX
- 4 human verification items pending: slide animation, pulse effect, instant snap-back, real PartyKit presence

### Phase 7: Leader Disconnect UI
- 3 TypeScript errors in `SessionScreen.test.tsx` mock overrides (lines 233, 244, 284) — literal `null` inference prevents union type assignment. Tests pass at runtime but would fail `tsc --noEmit`.

### Phase 3: Song Rendering
- `ChordLine.tsx` imports from `../../client/lib/chord-tokenizer` instead of `../lib/chord-tokenizer` — cosmetic, resolves correctly

### Total: 9 items across 4 phases

## Human Verification Pending

1. **Phase 3:** Color rendering under stage lighting (gold/blue/purple) and independent scroll behavior
2. **Phase 5:** Slide-left animation on auto-follow, pulse effect on leader advance, instant Go Live snap-back, all users in real PartyKit presence list

## Test Suite

- **191 tests** across 14 files — all passing
- **0 failures, 0 skipped**

## Changes Since Previous Audit

- Phase 7 (Leader Disconnect UI) completed — SYNC-02 gap closed
- `leaderDisconnected` export no longer orphaned — consumed by `LeaderDisconnectBanner` in `SessionScreen`
- 6 new tests added (3 unit, 3 integration)
- Test count: 185 → 191
- Previous status: tech_debt (28/29) → Current status: gaps_found (29/32, Phase 6 now in scope)
