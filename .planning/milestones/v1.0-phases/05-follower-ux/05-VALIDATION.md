# Phase 5 — Validation Strategy

> Generated by `gsd-phase-researcher` during `/gsd:plan-phase 5`.
> Updated by `gsd-plan-checker` after plan approval.
> Governs feedback sampling during `/gsd:execute-phase 5`.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | Vitest 3.2.4 + React Testing Library 16.3.2 |
| **Config file** | vite.config (Vitest config integrated) |
| **Quick run command** | `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose` |
| **Full suite command** | `npx vitest run` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~5 seconds |
| **CI pipeline** | None — local testing only |

---

## Nyquist Sampling Rate

> The minimum feedback frequency required to reliably catch errors in this phase.

- **After every task commit:** Run `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `npx vitest run`
- **Before `/gsd:verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Maximum acceptable task feedback latency:** 5 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| TBD | 01 | 0 | FOLL-03, FOLL-04 | unit | `npx vitest run src/client/__tests__/GoLiveBanner.test.tsx` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| TBD | 01 | 0 | PRES-01, PRES-02 | unit | `npx vitest run src/client/__tests__/PresenceList.test.tsx` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| TBD | 01 | 1 | FOLL-01 | unit | `npx vitest run src/client/__tests__/SessionScreen.test.tsx` | ✅ (needs new cases) | ⬜ pending |
| TBD | 01 | 1 | FOLL-03, FOLL-04 | unit | `npx vitest run src/client/__tests__/GoLiveBanner.test.tsx` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |
| TBD | 02 | 1 | PRES-01, PRES-02 | unit | `npx vitest run src/client/__tests__/PresenceList.test.tsx` | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status values: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

## Wave 0 Requirements

> Test scaffolding committed BEFORE any implementation task. Executor runs Wave 0 first.

- [ ] `src/client/__tests__/GoLiveBanner.test.tsx` — stubs for FOLL-03, FOLL-04
- [ ] `src/client/__tests__/PresenceList.test.tsx` — stubs for PRES-01, PRES-02

*Existing infrastructure covers framework setup and shared fixtures from Phase 1.*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

> Behaviors that genuinely cannot be automated, with justification.
> These are surfaced during `/gsd:verify-work` UAT.

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Slide-left animation visually smooth | FOLL-01 | Visual smoothness cannot be asserted in jsdom | Open two tabs, leader advances, verify follower sees smooth slide |
| Gold border visible around screen | FOLL-03 | Ring visual requires real rendering | Browse away from live song, confirm gold border appears |
| Pulse animation on leader advance | FOLL-03 | CSS animation timing requires visual verification | Leader advances while follower browsing, confirm pulse |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

Updated by `gsd-plan-checker` when plans are approved:

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify commands or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] No 3 consecutive implementation tasks without automated verify (sampling continuity)
- [ ] Wave 0 test files cover all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags in any automated command
- [ ] Feedback latency per task: < 5s ✅
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Plan-checker approval:** pending

## Execution Tracking

Updated during `/gsd:execute-phase 5`:

| Wave | Tasks | Tests Run | Pass | Fail | Sampling Status |
|------|-------|-----------|------|------|-----------------|
| 0 | TBD | — | — | — | scaffold |
| 1 | TBD | `npx vitest run` | — | — | ⬜ pending |

**Phase validation complete:** pending
