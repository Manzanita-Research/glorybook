## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Source Key
- **V** = VERIFICATION.md status

Note: SUMMARY frontmatter `requirements-completed` field only present in Phase 1 SUMMARYs (added during Phase 8 tech debt cleanup). Phases 2-8 SUMMARYs use `requires/provides/affects` dependency frontmatter instead. All requirements verified through the other two sources (VERIFICATION.md + traceability table).

## Integration Check

**Cross-phase wiring:** 32/32 requirement integration paths verified. 0 orphaned requirement-bearing exports.

**Unused hook exports (benign):** `myUser`, `actions.disconnect`, `actions.setSetlist` — fully implemented but no component calls them. Not required by any v1.0 requirement.

**E2E Flows:**

| Flow | Requirements | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Leader joins and starts session | SHELL-01, JOIN-01-03, SYNC-01, SONG-01-05, LEAD-01-03 | Complete |
| Follower joins via QR code scan | JOIN-04, SESS-01, SESS-02 | Complete |
| Follower browses and snaps back | FOLL-01-04 | Complete |
| Leader disconnects, grace period shown | SYNC-02 | Complete |
| Leadership transfer | LEAD-04 | Complete |

**WebSocket message coverage:** All 7 `ClientMessage` types handled by server. All 8 `ServerMessage` types handled by hook. No unhandled messages.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 1: Sync Layer Hardening
- Hibernation + storage sharding not tested against actual Cloudflare deploy (deferred to production)

### Phase 5: Follower UX
- 4 human verification items pending: slide animation, pulse effect, instant snap-back, real PartyKit presence (requires two browser tabs in running session)

### Global
- SUMMARY frontmatter `requirements-completed` field only present in Phase 1 — Phases 2-8 lack it
- 3 unused hook exports (`myUser`, `actions.disconnect`, `actions.setSetlist`) — benign, available for future use

### Total: 4 items across 3 categories

## Changes Since Previous Audit

- Phase 8 (Clean Up Tech Debt) completed — all 10 original tech debt items resolved or documented
- Previous 3 TypeScript errors in SessionScreen.test.tsx: **fixed** (UseDeadSyncReturn exported, mock typed)
- Previous cosmetic ChordLine.tsx import path: **fixed** (canonical `../lib/` path)
- Previous dead exports in chord-tokenizer.ts: **documented** with `@internal` JSDoc
- Previous missing Phase 1 VERIFICATION.md: **created** retroactively
- Previous missing SUMMARY frontmatter (Phase 1 + 03-02): **Phase 1 added** (03-02 still missing)
- Tech debt items: 10 → 4 (6 resolved, 4 remaining as minor/deferred)
- Previous status: tech_debt → Current status: **passed** (all requirements satisfied, remaining debt is non-blocking)

## Test Suite

- **208 tests** across 16 files — all passing
- **0 failures, 0 skipped**
- **0 TypeScript errors** (`tsc --noEmit` clean)

## Human Verification Pending

1. **Phase 3:** Color rendering under stage lighting (gold/blue/purple) and independent scroll behavior
2. **Phase 5:** Slide-left animation on auto-follow, pulse effect on leader advance, instant Go Live snap-back, all users in real PartyKit presence list
